# SFCore
The core for all of my (SirFaizdat's) plugins. Provides the core libraries needed by
each of my plugins, which allows for the code to be written more efficiently.

**This project has been abandoned.** This library is no longer needed due to efforts from other open source projects.

## Features
- JSON serialization system that serializes objects to JSON and back.
- Custom MC2Web communication system
- Easy integration with Vault and other plugins
- Annotation based command system
- Particle library
- HUD library (titles, subtitles, actionbar, and scoreboard)
- Colorful logger
- Localization utility

## Compiling
If you wish to compile the code by yourself, simply clone this repository, make your
changes, and then run ```mvn package``` in the clone directory to create the jar.
